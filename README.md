This is a Next.js project that serves as the frontend of the [Task-Manager-Api](https://github.com/HadiMalikDev/Task-Api-Node).

The live version of the project is hosted on Netlify.

## Description
This project is the first frontend project of mine created using ReactJS. This project makes the Task Manager application a full-stack application, constructed in MERN stack. The frontend communicates using both the REST and GraphQL endpoints.

The site is responsive too! ^-^

## Afterthoughts on the project:
Overall, it took me around 10-ish days to construct the frontend. I had had enough of watching React tutorials, and wanted to learn by doing, rather than watching.

The main difficulties I encountered were managing state, though it did get resolved quickly. State and hooks were rather easy to pick up, owing to my previous experience in Flutter, which too is declarative. The concepts I learnt in Flutter could be ported to React, hence allowing me to 'think in React' easily.

## Live Version

## What's next for this app
I plan on adding a toggle theme(Dark and Light modes) button to the entire application. As is well known, programmers hate light mode. Hehe. If the backend gets an update(by yours truly), the frontend could see small or large overhauls as per requirement. Also, if users have any suggestions, then their suggestions might just get implemented too!
